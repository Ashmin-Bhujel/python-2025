# Mutable and Immutable

- Everything in python is an object
- Mutable
  - The mutable object can be modified after its creation
  - Slower to access than immutable objects but can be easily modified
  - e.g. List, Dictionary, Set etc.
- Immutable
  - The immutable object cannot be modified after its creation
  - Faster to access but expensive to modify (due to the process of creating a copy)
  - e.g. Integer, Float, String, Tuple etc.
