# Loops Practice

- [x] 00 - Counting Positive Numbers

  > Given a list of numbers, count how many are positive.

  ```python
  numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, 6, -7, -8, 9, 10]
  ```

- [x] 01 - Sum of Even Numbers

  > Calculate the sum of even numbers up to a given number n.

- [x] 02 - Multiplication Table Printer

  > Print the multiplication table for a given number up to 10, but skip the fifth iteration.

- [x] 03 - Reverse a String

  > Reverse a string using a loop.

- [x] 04 - Find the First Non-Repeated Character

  > Given a string, find the first non-repeated character.

- [ ] 05 - Factorial Calculator

  > Compute the factorial of a number using a while loop.

- [ ] 06 - Validate Input

  > Keep asking the user for input until they enter a number between 1 and 10.

- [ ] 07 - Prime Number Checker

  > Check if a number is prime.

- [ ] 08 - List Uniqueness Checker

  > Check if all elements in a list are unique. If a duplicate is found, exit the loop and print the duplicate.

  ```python
  items = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "apple", "mango"]
  ```

- [ ] 09 - Exponential Backoff

  > Implement an exponential backoff strategy that doubles the wait time between retries, starting from 1 second, but stops after 5 retries.
