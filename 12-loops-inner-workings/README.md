# Loops Inner Workings

- iter() or \_\_iter\_\_ method
  - If the object is iterable iter() will return response to the iteration tool with iterator object along with next() or \_\_next\_\_ method
  - The iterator object always points to the same memory reference (first address), but the \_\_next\_\_ does some behind the scene work to iterate over the addresses
- StopIteration exception
- Iteration tools
  - Loops
  - Comprehensions
- Iterable objects
  - String
  - Lists
  - Dictionaries
  - Sets
  - Tuples
  - Range
  - Files
    - open("filename")
    - for files the variable and iter(variable) are same, but for other iterable objects they are different
    - readline() (Handles StopIteration exception)
    - next() (Raw method, Does not handle StopIteration exception)
