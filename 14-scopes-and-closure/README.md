# Scopes and Closure

- Most the programming languages have the same fundamental concept of scopes
- Python is no different the only different is syntax, in other languages there are curly braces whereas there are indentation in python
- Global and function scope
- We should use the global keyword inside a function rarely and carefully
- Closure is a condition where we can return a function definition from a function, and that returned function will come with its bagage of variable it is referencing to
