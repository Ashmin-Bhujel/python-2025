# Object Oriented Programming

- [x] 00 - Basic Class and Object

  > Create a Car class with attributes like brand and model. Then create an instance of this class.

- [x] 01 - Class Method and Self

  > Add a method to the Car class that displays the full name of the car (brand and model).

- [x] 02 - Inheritance

  > Create an ElectricCar class that inherits from the Car class and has an additional attribute battery_size.

- [x] 03 - Encapsulation

  > Modify the Car class to encapsulate the brand attribute, making it private, and provide a getter method for it.

- [ ] 04 - Polymorphism

  > Demonstrate polymorphism by defining a method fuel_type in both Car and ElectricCar classes, but with different behaviors.

- [ ] 05 - Class Variables

  > Add a class variable to Car that keeps track of the number of cars created.

- [ ] 06 - Static Method

  > Add a static method to the Car class that returns a general description of a car.

- [ ] 07 - Property Decorators

  > Use a property decorator in the Car class to make the model attribute read-only.

- [ ] 08 - Class Inheritance and isinstance() Function

  > Demonstrate the use of isinstance() to check if my_tesla is an instance of Car and ElectricCar.

- [ ] 09 - Multiple Inheritance

  > Create two classes Battery and Engine, and let the ElectricCar class inherit from both, demonstrating multiple inheritance.
