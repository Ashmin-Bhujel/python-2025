# Decorators

- [x] 00 - Timing Function Execution

  > Write a decorator that measures the time a function takes to execute.

- [x] 01 - Debugging Function Calls

  > Create a decorator to print the function name and the values of its arguments every time the function is called.

- [x] 02 - Cache Return Values

  > Implement a decorator that caches the return values of a function, so that when it's called with the same arguments, the cached value is returned instead of re-executing the function.
